## 📌 Problem Statement

Predicting how a cancer cell line responds to a drug is a **central challenge in precision oncology**.  
Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture:

- High-dimensional **multi-omics data**
- Complex **drug–genome interactions**
- Non-linear and context-dependent relationships

DeepCDR-Hybrid addresses these challenges using **transformer-based multi-omics encoding** and **hybrid drug representations**, achieving **significant performance improvements** over existing methods.
